## Shell-identification

# Problem Statement:

The shell dataset was labeled by its scientific name such as Aandara consociata, etc.
The goal is to predict the likelihood that a shell is from a certain class from the provided labels, thus it is a multi-class classification problem.
The goal is to train a classifier that would be able to classify the shell into these labels.

## Project feasibility:
# Data Exploration and Visualizations:
The dataset consists of 7894 shell species with 29622 samples, where totally 59244 shell images are present.
Each species has shell samples ranging from 1 to 87 respectively, and every shell sample has two photographs with frontal and lateral view.
Each image is labelled with its scientific name and of size 300*400 pixels.
